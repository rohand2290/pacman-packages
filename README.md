# pacman-packages
A series of Pacman Packages located in the AUR that are built here.

## Install
To install any of these packages, just run
```
sudo pacman -U file-name
```
where `file-name` is the name of the package.

## Purpose
Some of the packages on the AUR do not build properly, so this is a passing binary of some packages.
